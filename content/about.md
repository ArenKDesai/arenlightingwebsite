![Me](../meinred.JPG)

I'm a new lighting designer with a powerful set of programming skills. I don't have many lights, but I can set up custom-programmed lights like my LED strip with the ESP 32 running micropython and a mosquitto server to sync its lights playing with a live performance and DMX lights. 

## What I Do

- Basic lighting for DIY venues and basement shows
- Custom lighting sets for local bands

I need experience so pricing is either free or very cheap for now. 

## Experience

I'm new - none so far.
