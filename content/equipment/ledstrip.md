## Specifications

- **Colors**: Anything between rgb (0,0,0) and (255,255,100-255) (near the end the blue light is limited to around 100)
- **Functions**: Currently flashing, running blobs of light, multi-colors, etc. 
- **Quantity**: 300 LEDs, 1 strip

300 LEDs in the light strip, controlled by an ESP32. I can program most of anything into the LED strip, but the programming takes time and effort, as does setting up the strip with tape or adhesive.
